## Description
To create a readme file automatically generated by this application.

I built this to be a tool that can be used to generate markdown files for future projects.

It solves the problem of having to manually create a readme file for each project.

I learned how to use node.js to dynamically create a file amongst other things.

Download the repo and unzip the file.

Open the folder in VS Code or a similar application.

Open an integrated terminal.

Type "node index" and press ENTER

Answer the prompts and press ENTER after each response
